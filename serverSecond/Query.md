```sql
SELECT orders.*, payments.status, payments.payment_mode
FROM orders
NATURAL JOIN payments
WHERE orders.customer_id=?
```

```sql
SELECT payments.status
FROM orders
NATURAL JOIN payments
WHERE orders.order_id=?
```

Retrieves the payment status for a specific order using a natural join, which automatically joins on the common order_id column.

FROM orders o
NATURAL JOIN customers c
NATURAL JOIN order_details od

       COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS order_count
FROM services s
NATURAL JOIN order_details od
NATURAL JOIN orders o
GROUP BY s.service_id, s.name
ORDER BY total_quantity DESC
LIMIT 5

Populates the services table with predefined service options.

## Database Triggers

### Calculate Subtotal Trigger

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE TRIGGER subtotal_insert
BEFORE INSERT ON order_details
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- Declare variable to store the price per item
    DECLARE subtota FLOAT;

    -- Fetch the price per item from the services table
    SELECT price_per_item INTO subtota
    FROM services
    WHERE service_id = NEW.service_id;

    -- Assign the calculated subtotal to the NEW row
    SET NEW.subtotal = subtota * NEW.quantity;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

This trigger automatically calculates the subtotal (price Ã— quantity) before inserting a new record into the order_details table.

### Update Final Total Trigger

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE TRIGGER final_total
AFTER INSERT ON order_details
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- Declare variable to store the sum of subtotals
    DECLARE final FLOAT;

    -- Calculate the sum of subtotals for the order and store it
    SELECT SUM(subtotal) INTO final
    FROM order_details
    WHERE order_id = NEW.order_id;

    -- Update the Final_total in the orders table
    UPDATE orders
    SET Final_Total = final
    WHERE order_id = NEW.order_id;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

This trigger automatically updates the Final_Total in the orders table whenever a new item is added to order_details, by summing all subtotals for that order.
